// Upload with metadata
final uploadOperation = Amplify.Storage.uploadFile(
  localFile: AWSFile.fromPath(wavFile.path),
  path: StoragePath.fromString(s3Path),
  options: StorageUploadFileOptions(
    metadata: {
      'fileType': 'audio',
      'uploadMethod': 'hardware_recorder',
      'source': 'hardware_audio_capture',
      'audioFormat': 'wav',
      'sampleRate': '16000',
